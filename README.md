>Finally, an app that can remove the headache of assignment for your gift exchange.
Our app uses a unique sorting algorithm coupled with the ability to ‘blacklist’ those 
you may not get along with to ensure you have a seamless gift exchange process (gifts not included).

### Development

>If you're on the CSE 110 instructional team, this section is for you!

The work for this app was a little hard for you to track because we had numerous problems trying to get git to work correctly. We have our own individual branches where we did most of our work. Some members of our group also chose to work locally and zip their progress then send it via Slack. Most of that work was uploaded the the `pre-release` branch. 
Our most comprehensive and polished product can be found on the `master` branch. BDD testing as well as all the latest commits leading up to the final lab session will also be on that branch.

### Design

>We've spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to approach this app and from a very early stage in it's development, we've had design at the forefront of our minds. As you can see from the following images, we've kept true to our UI promise. In our first meeting with our clients, we presented the following images and the clients loved them. We've made sure at every step of the way to keep to this design promise and you'll see we did just that.
